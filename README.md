# Dot Product
a = [a1,a2,a3,...]
b = [b1,b2,b3,...]
a.b = a1.b1 + a2.b2 + a3.b3 + ...

## Cosine Theorem

That means the vectors multiply with their magnitude and cosine value between the 1st and 2nd vectors.

a.b = |a|.|b|.cos(theta) or a.b = ax.bx + ay.by

# Cross Product (Extra)

The result gives a vectoral value.

Vector Cross = i x j = k, j*k = i, k x i = j

a = a1_i, a2_j, a3_k
b = b1_i, b2_j, b3_k

axb = (a2b3-a3b2)i - (a1b3-a3b1)j + (a1b2 -a2b1)k
